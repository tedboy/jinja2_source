With Statement
--------------

**Import name:** `jinja2.ext.with_`

.. versionadded:: 2.3

This extension adds support for the with keyword.  Using this keyword it
is possible to enforce a nested scope in a template.  Variables can be
declared directly in the opening block of the with statement or using a
standard `set` statement directly within.
